# typst-template-paper

A `typst` template for a IEEE paper, building with nix.

This is mainly for personal use and to discover/learn how typst works, but maybe
someone finds this intersting/useful.

Feature requests will be ignored if not accompanied by a PR implementing them -
and then only if I find it useful.
