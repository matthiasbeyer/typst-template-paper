# typst-template-paper

A `typst` template repository **FOR PERSONAL USE**.

This is intended as _template repository_ not as _typst template_.
This means, I use this repository to kickstart other repositories. I do not use
this repository as template for a typst document.

This is mainly for personal use and to discover/learn how typst works, but maybe
someone finds this intersting/useful.

Feature requests will be ignored if not accompanied by a PR implementing them -
and then only if I find it useful.
